# SQL to-do list
* Time: 16 hours, over a weekend.

At Prime, we were asked to use our newly acquired database skills to build a dynamic to-do list, utilizing postgres and SQL. 

## Instruction

Our task was to create a database, to store user inputs (specifically tasks on a to-do list), where users could create and manipulate the data, server-side, while interacting with a client-side interface. One of the required components is that users should be able to see a visible representation of all "submit", "delete" and "complete" functions. These two functions were to manipulate entries stored in our local database. We were also asked to explore some basic styling in CSS.

## Construction

This week we learned about git branching and how to make pull requests. I made sure to implement this practice as much as possible during the build. 

We also learned about router files and storing data/functions/routes on a file separate from the server itself. That, along with creating a module utilizing postgres and connecting the database itself, proved to be challenging at first. After spending some time combing through the various paths, I was able to find any small mistakes disrupting the transfer of data. 

The logic itself wasn't very challenging in this assignment, but figuring out the right selectors did provide a slight road-bump. This was my first attempt at using multiple classes on a single element. With trial-and-error and some patience, I was able to select the right elements for most of my features. 


## Stretch

As an optional exercise, we were guided towards learning Bootstrap and implementing it within our app, specifically using their library of buttons/inputs and looking into their responsive design. This was absolutely the most difficult thing I faced during this project. Learning their version of grid was difficult at best. I am however, excited to spend some time learning how to utilize this library and others in the future. 

An additional feature I decided to take on, with our instructor's suggestion, to add an alert attached to our "delete" button. I looked at another CSS library called "sweetalert" and imported their code with success.
